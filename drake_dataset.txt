Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days.

That's me there\I'm jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare\Putting in that overtime I never said it'd be fair\I'm always left wishin' I could have done it in person\My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin'\I got new girls but none of they love is for certain\And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin'\Damn, what happened to us?\Life can always change, you have to adjust\How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?\They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus\Especially when I come flyin' through the door\And kindly ignore, the paparazzi outside tryin' to record\Why has every woman never dined here before?\Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?\The Rothschilds, the Cru's, the Gajas and the Opuses\It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices\My condo got that art gallery openness\I'm just really hopin' that that isn’t what your motive is\\[Pre-Chorus]\They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me\I'm only sayin' can somebody just be happy for me?\I really hate to say I told you so\So I bite my tongue but you know you know\\[Chorus]\You know, you know\You know, you know
